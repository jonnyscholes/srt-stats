2
00:01:23,696 --> 00:01:25,616
Oh, God.

3
00:01:27,173 --> 00:01:29,091
There you go.
Why didn't you wake me?

4
00:01:29,092 --> 00:01:31,410
- I did. You told me to piss off.
- I don't remember.

5
00:01:31,411 --> 00:01:34,651
- I do.
- All the clocks have stopped in the whole house.

6
00:01:34,652 --> 00:01:37,852
- It's probably just a fuse.
- Oh, Mum, I've got a temperature.

7
00:01:37,853 --> 00:01:40,091
- You haven't.
- I'm not going.

8
00:01:40,092 --> 00:01:43,252
- If I have to, you have to. Doesn't she?
- Not getting involved.

9
00:01:43,253 --> 00:01:44,732
- Ooh-ooh!
- Hi, Mum.

10
00:01:44,733 --> 00:01:47,771
- Morning, Liz.
- Fresh eggs, we had a bumper lay.

11
00:01:47,772 --> 00:01:50,053
- Look at them, eh? Love you zillions.
- OK.

12
00:01:50,054 --> 00:01:52,812
- Er... oi!
- Hello, love.

13
00:01:52,813 --> 00:01:54,771
- I've got a temperature.
- Have you now?

14
00:01:54,772 --> 00:01:57,011
She hasn't.
Gotta go. I'm late to meet Nige.

15
00:01:57,012 --> 00:01:59,692
- Have you seen Danny? He forgot his lunch.
- Probably already gone.

16
00:01:59,693 --> 00:02:02,373
All right. I'm late.
Cheerio, love.

17
00:02:11,452 --> 00:02:13,251
- Get off!
- All right, you lot?

18
00:02:13,252 --> 00:02:16,411
- How's it going? All right?
- My first day back at work, ask me later.

19
00:02:16,412 --> 00:02:18,891
- Sports Day, isn't it? Show 'em what you got.
- I will.

20
00:02:18,892 --> 00:02:21,892
- We should get the lads out.
- Definitely. I'll text you later.

21
00:02:21,893 --> 00:02:23,972
All right, Jen?

22
00:02:23,973 --> 00:02:26,011
Sorry, love. Sorry.

23
00:02:26,012 --> 00:02:28,570
Where were you for five-a-side last
Tuesday?

24
00:02:28,571 --> 00:02:30,611
Sorry. I had to go over to Lyme.

25
00:02:30,612 --> 00:02:33,292
- Mate's band were playing.
- No excuses next time, eh?

26
00:02:33,293 --> 00:02:35,292
Yeah.

27
00:02:35,812 --> 00:02:38,932
- Morning, ladies.
- All right, how are you?

28
00:02:39,653 --> 00:02:41,292
Hey.

29
00:02:41,293 --> 00:02:43,571
- Morning, Oll.
- All right, Mark? How's it going?

30
00:02:43,572 --> 00:02:46,250
Beautiful weather.
Sunshine and showers they reckon.

31
00:02:46,251 --> 00:02:48,970
How's your mum? Is she OK?
Not bad, thanks for asking.

32
00:02:48,971 --> 00:02:51,933
- Pass on my love.
- Yeah, will do, mate. Absolutely.

33
00:02:51,934 --> 00:02:55,292
- Oi, don't you sneak past.
- Knock, knock.

34
00:02:55,293 --> 00:02:57,130
All right, Maggie?
All right, Mark?

35
00:02:57,131 --> 00:03:00,893
- Got your ad renewal for you there, Mag.
- Ah, a week late.

36
00:03:00,894 --> 00:03:03,892
Oh, sorry, no-one's perfect, eh?

37
00:03:05,212 --> 00:03:07,212
Lovely morning for it.

38
00:03:08,973 --> 00:03:10,973
All right, Becca?

39
00:03:11,132 --> 00:03:13,890
Your hotel started
that tradesman's discount yet?

40
00:03:13,891 --> 00:03:17,252
- You've gotta have class to eat here.
- Class? I'm all class, me.

41
00:03:17,253 --> 00:03:19,252
Keep telling yourself that.

42
00:03:21,212 --> 00:03:24,612
- You're late.
- Yeah, sorry, traffic's really stacking up.

43
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:31,173
There's all them lovely tourist girls
ripe for your picking.

44
00:03:31,174 --> 00:03:32,892
Shut up!

45
00:03:32,893 --> 00:03:35,093
So, what was the upshot of last
night, then?

46
00:03:37,412 --> 00:03:39,333
How about you just drive?

47
00:03:40,933 --> 00:03:44,332
Morning. You all right? Hi. Morning!

48
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:47,291
Hi, I'm back!

49
00:03:47,292 --> 00:03:50,651
Thank you very much. Quite
right too.

50
00:03:50,652 --> 00:03:53,652
Dom, I got you lung busters,
against my better judgment.

51
00:03:53,653 --> 00:03:57,172
Nish. Look. Vodka, black label.

52
00:03:57,173 --> 00:03:59,330
- Very nice. Thank you.
- Not at all.

53
00:03:59,331 --> 00:04:02,491
- Anna, I got you lip gloss for all your kissing.
- Thank you.

54
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:06,411
- Mike... moisturizer. Give that lovely face a lift.
- Thank you.

55
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:09,251
I got you a cuddly penguin, Frank.
I know you get lonely.

56
00:04:09,252 --> 00:04:11,213
Come on, then. What's all the
gossip?

57
00:04:11,214 --> 00:04:14,652
Ellie. Welcome back. Can I have a
quick word?

58
00:04:16,813 --> 00:04:20,932
- What's the news?
- We've given the job to someone else.

59
00:04:20,933 --> 00:04:22,891
- What?
- I know it's a disappointment.

60
00:04:22,892 --> 00:04:26,132
You said it'd wait till I got back from leave.
You said I was a shoo-in. That's why I took 3 weeks!

61
00:04:26,133 --> 00:04:28,773
- The situation changed.
- Christ!

62
00:04:30,372 --> 00:04:33,092
- Who? Who got it?
- DI Alec Hardy.

63
00:04:33,093 --> 00:04:35,252
A man?

64
00:04:35,253 --> 00:04:37,451
What happened to "The area
needs a female DI"?

65
00:04:37,452 --> 00:04:39,292
What happened to "I've got your
backing"?

66
00:04:39,372 --> 00:04:42,930
- Alec Hardy has a lot of experience.
- Why do I know that name?

67
00:04:42,931 --> 00:04:45,232
He was in charge of the Sandbrook
murders.

68
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:47,243
Are you kidding me?

69
00:04:49,043 --> 00:04:51,203
- When does he start?
- Last week.

70
00:04:53,443 --> 00:04:55,443
You wanna see this or not?

71
00:05:01,122 --> 00:05:04,562
Yep, OK. Received.

72
00:05:07,403 --> 00:05:10,603
That's where they cut to get in.
Siphoned the whole bloody tank.

73
00:05:12,803 --> 00:05:14,803
We'll be in touch.

74
00:05:16,363 --> 00:05:18,363
Is that it?

75
00:05:21,282 --> 00:05:23,282
What about forensics?

76
00:05:23,923 --> 00:05:25,840
I can't afford this, the price of
diesel.

77
00:05:25,841 --> 00:05:29,841
- You called me at seven in the morning for that.
- Too good for it, are you?

78
00:05:29,842 --> 00:05:33,640
Just got a call. Coast Guard reported
something down by the shore.

79
00:05:33,641 --> 00:05:36,601
After all she said to me, what's the
bloody point?

80
00:05:36,602 --> 00:05:38,801
Shall I just walk out, clear my desk
and go?

81
00:05:38,802 --> 00:05:42,723
No, I know. But you should have seen
me, I was so happy coming back.

82
00:05:42,724 --> 00:05:44,281
I'm in here!

83
00:05:44,282 --> 00:05:46,403
Ellie, you've got a shout.

84
00:05:47,283 --> 00:05:48,363
Gotta go.

85
00:05:49,523 --> 00:05:52,922
- Can you see Danny? I can't see him.
- He'll be with his class.

86
00:05:54,283 --> 00:05:56,840
I can't believe you're making me
come to this.

87
00:05:56,841 --> 00:05:59,962
Hey, your choice. Stay here or get
on to your own school.

88
00:06:01,122 --> 00:06:03,880
- Oh, all right. I'll go in.
- I love you very much.

89
00:06:03,881 --> 00:06:07,202
And if you remember that smile
give it a go for me, would you?

90
00:06:13,402 --> 00:06:15,641
Usain Bolt. OK?

91
00:06:15,642 --> 00:06:17,642
Now all look egg-cited.

92
00:06:22,803 --> 00:06:25,162
Hiya.
All right?

93
00:06:26,163 --> 00:06:28,882
Beth? No Danny?

94
00:06:28,883 --> 00:06:32,003
Oh, I thought he was here.
No, we haven't seen him today.

95
00:06:33,443 --> 00:06:37,323
- Well, did you do the register?
- Yeah, we haven't seen him since yesterday.

96
00:06:37,324 --> 00:06:39,122
Miss?

97
00:06:44,722 --> 00:06:48,400
Danny, it's Mum. So, you're not at school.
Can you give me a call straightaway, sweetheart?

98
00:06:48,401 --> 00:06:50,441
I just wanna know where you are.

99
00:06:50,442 --> 00:06:54,483
Jack, it's Beth. Danny did his paper
round this morning, right?

100
00:06:56,842 --> 00:06:59,163
Oh, er... OK. Did he ring?

101
00:07:01,163 --> 00:07:05,403
No, no, no, it's fine. I'm just...
just not quite sure where he is, that's all.

102
00:07:07,162 --> 00:07:09,082
Mark, it's me. Ring me now.

103
00:07:12,323 --> 00:07:14,323
Tom? Tom!

104
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:18,723
Danny didn't say he was going
anywhere this morning, did he?

105
00:07:18,724 --> 00:07:20,281
It's alright, he's not in trouble.

106
00:07:20,282 --> 00:07:22,722
- OK. Thank you.
- Can I do anything?

107
00:07:22,723 --> 00:07:25,402
- Just give me a call if he shows up.
- Yeah, sure.

108
00:07:26,883 --> 00:07:28,202
Hey, Tom.

109
00:07:42,563 --> 00:07:44,361
Oh, come on. Come on.

110
00:07:44,362 --> 00:07:46,640
Main road to the coast
at Broadchurch.

111
00:07:46,641 --> 00:07:50,002
If you are heading to the beach
I suggest you make other plans.

112
00:07:53,882 --> 00:07:56,921
- What's going on?
- Someone said the police are at the beach.

113
00:07:56,922 --> 00:07:58,402
They might have found a body.

114
00:08:28,523 --> 00:08:30,523
Stand back. Stand back, please.

115
00:08:34,002 --> 00:08:36,123
Oh, God, don't do this to me.

116
00:09:10,962 --> 00:09:12,683
Come on.

117
00:09:32,403 --> 00:09:34,561
- Oh, God. No, no, no.
- Off the beach.

118
00:09:34,562 --> 00:09:37,043
- This area's off-limits.
- No, I'm police.

119
00:09:38,082 --> 00:09:40,882
Oh, God, I know him. He lives here.

120
00:09:41,962 --> 00:09:44,520
He has tea at my house.
He's my boy's best friend.

121
00:09:44,521 --> 00:09:47,161
- Oh, God, Beth. Does Beth know?
- All right, calm down, DS Miller

122
00:09:47,162 --> 00:09:49,800
- You don't understand. I know that boy.
- Shut it off.

123
00:09:49,801 --> 00:09:52,920
- "Shut it off"?
- Be professional. You're working a case now.

124
00:09:52,921 --> 00:09:54,721
- Alec Hardy.
- I know. You got my job.

125
00:09:54,722 --> 00:09:57,283
- Really? You wanna do that now?
- You don't even know who he is.

126
00:09:57,284 --> 00:09:59,283
Tell me!

127
00:10:00,522 --> 00:10:04,323
Danny. Daniel Latimer. 11 years old.
Goes to school with my boy Tom.

128
00:10:04,883 --> 00:10:07,520
His family live here. Dad's the
local plumber.

129
00:10:07,521 --> 00:10:10,123
- Is this a suicide spot?
- He wouldn't do that.

130
00:10:10,763 --> 00:10:12,762
Answer the question.

131
00:10:13,122 --> 00:10:17,081
No.  There are others - one three miles
west; another one further inland.

132
00:10:17,082 --> 00:10:19,401
He's not that type of kid.
Find out where SOCO are.

133
00:10:19,402 --> 00:10:21,603
We have to move fast.
That tide'll be in.

134
00:10:41,402 --> 00:10:43,203
Oh, God.

135
00:11:03,522 --> 00:11:05,401
Oh, God. Who's that?

136
00:11:05,402 --> 00:11:08,280
- No, Beth, get off the beach.
- What have you found?

137
00:11:08,281 --> 00:11:10,683
- Let me see, let me see.
- You can't be here!

138
00:11:11,002 --> 00:11:13,802
- Stop. Get her off the beach. Get her away from here.
- Those are his shoes.

139
00:11:13,803 --> 00:11:17,721
- Come on, come on.
- Those are Danny's trainers!

140
00:11:17,722 --> 00:11:19,923
No!

141
00:11:23,642 --> 00:11:25,243
Danny!

142
00:11:51,444 --> 00:11:54,284
- Ah, Olly, you're back.
- Survived Sports Day.

143
00:11:54,379 --> 00:11:56,377
Not only that - coffees.

144
00:11:56,395 --> 00:11:58,354
- Ah.
- That's three shots.

145
00:11:58,355 --> 00:12:03,354
Double-page spread. Spell all the
children's names correctly, please.

146
00:12:03,419 --> 00:12:05,779
I don't want the parents berating me.

147
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:09,858
So, Reg didn't turn up. Red Lion.

148
00:12:09,859 --> 00:12:12,139
- What, you mean we've got no pictures?
- Ah.

149
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:15,258
Camera phone. I took them myself.

150
00:12:15,259 --> 00:12:18,259
Ah... good initiative, Olly.

151
00:12:19,819 --> 00:12:21,819
Show me how to download these?

152
00:12:27,139 --> 00:12:29,817
Why do still use Reg?
He always lets you down.

153
00:12:29,818 --> 00:12:34,139
I see Reg in the supermarket every
Saturday. We look after our own here.

154
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:36,659
Oh, look at their little faces.

155
00:12:37,779 --> 00:12:41,419
Oh, that's very nice. You've almost
got an eye.

156
00:12:42,499 --> 00:12:45,497
I tell Reg I'm using camera phone
pictures in the paper.

157
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:47,659
He'll be back and sober within the
hour.

158
00:12:53,099 --> 00:12:56,299
Oh, my God. It's the Daily Mail.
It's my application.

159
00:12:57,979 --> 00:12:59,699
Open it.

160
00:13:04,179 --> 00:13:06,018
Bastards!

161
00:13:06,091 --> 00:13:07,651
Oh, sweetheart.

162
00:13:08,971 --> 00:13:12,329
- There's plenty of other newspapers.
- I've tried them all now.

163
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:14,731
You're good, petal. Your time will
come.

164
00:13:21,531 --> 00:13:23,531
Now, look, text from Yvonne.

165
00:13:24,371 --> 00:13:27,291
She says the beach is closed off
for some reason.

166
00:13:28,411 --> 00:13:30,811
Go down, check it out, will you?
Get yourself some fresh air.

167
00:13:32,611 --> 00:13:34,411
Sure.

168
00:13:41,971 --> 00:13:44,889
They let people walk along
here, no safety barriers?

169
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:47,491
It's a coastal path. People know to
be careful.

170
00:13:48,063 --> 00:13:50,063
It's a death trap.

171
00:13:51,543 --> 00:13:55,021
- How's it going?
- Well, from what we've got up here, sir,

172
00:13:55,022 --> 00:13:58,181
it looks like the rock fall
around the body was faked.

173
00:13:58,182 --> 00:14:01,103
What do you mean?
The angle of the body was wrong.

174
00:14:01,104 --> 00:14:02,622
It was too arranged.

175
00:14:02,623 --> 00:14:05,183
And up here there's no flattened
grass or slippage.

176
00:14:05,184 --> 00:14:08,302
No loose rocks. No fibres, no hand
marks.

177
00:14:08,303 --> 00:14:11,263
- No sense of a downward trajectory.
- You mean he didn't fall?

178
00:14:11,783 --> 00:14:13,181
Could he have jumped?

179
00:14:13,182 --> 00:14:17,063
That's unlikely, sir, given where he
was found and the trajectory
off the cliffs.

180
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:18,742
See, not Danny.

181
00:14:18,743 --> 00:14:22,063
If you ask me... someone tried to
make it look like an accident.

182
00:14:22,783 --> 00:14:24,783
I don't think he was up here.

183
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:42,421
Get on to the pathologist. Tell him
to hurry up.

184
00:14:42,422 --> 00:14:44,423
Even if it is just preliminary.

185
00:14:46,823 --> 00:14:48,462
- DS Miller!
- Who's that?

186
00:14:48,463 --> 00:14:49,981
- Just keep walking.
- Ellie!

187
00:14:49,982 --> 00:14:51,781
- He seems to know you.
- Auntie Ellie.

188
00:14:51,782 --> 00:14:54,981
- I told you, don't do that.
- Olly Stevens, Broadchurch Echo.

189
00:14:54,982 --> 00:14:57,623
I was down at the other end.  They said you'd 
be here. Why has the beach been closed?

190
00:14:57,624 --> 00:14:59,462
No statements now.

191
00:14:59,463 --> 00:15:02,263
I heard there was a body. Has it
been ID'd?

192
00:15:02,743 --> 00:15:05,543
- Please.
- There will be a statement, Oliver.

193
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:28,343
- Are they all in there?
- Sir, I can lead this with the family.

194
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:29,822
No.

195
00:15:29,823 --> 00:15:32,581
- I know them. 
- How many deaths like this have you worked?

196
00:15:32,582 --> 00:15:35,741
- This is my first.
- You can't make it better. Don't try.

197
00:15:35,742 --> 00:15:39,623
- You don't know how I work.
- Most likely premise is abduction.

198
00:15:39,624 --> 00:15:42,222
Was he taken? If so, who by?

199
00:15:42,223 --> 00:15:43,781
Watch them. Every movement.

200
00:15:43,782 --> 00:15:46,103
If anything doesn't make sense you
tell me.

201
00:15:46,463 --> 00:15:47,463
OK.

202
00:15:48,983 --> 00:15:50,983
Don't look at me like that.

203
00:16:23,183 --> 00:16:24,823
Morning.

204
00:16:26,223 --> 00:16:28,223
Morning.

205
00:16:29,343 --> 00:16:32,663
I'm Detective Inspector Alec Hardy
and you know DS Miller.

206
00:16:34,663 --> 00:16:38,103
Why don't you take a seat? We need
to talk about something. Yeah.

207
00:16:38,104 --> 00:16:40,142
Sit down.
Get a chair.

208
00:16:40,143 --> 00:16:41,943
Don't worry, I can do it.

209
00:16:56,383 --> 00:16:59,741
- The body of a young boy was found...
- It's Danny, isn't it?

210
00:16:59,742 --> 00:17:02,103
- I saw his shoes.
- Plenty of kids have those shoes.

211
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:04,103
Sorry. You talk.

212
00:17:05,863 --> 00:17:07,863
We believe it's Danny's body.

213
00:17:09,103 --> 00:17:12,583
Who is it, Ellie? Was it him?

214
00:17:18,103 --> 00:17:20,103
Hey.

215
00:17:21,383 --> 00:17:23,383
Hey.

216
00:17:27,423 --> 00:17:29,103
Hey, it's all right.

217
00:17:29,623 --> 00:17:31,623
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

218
00:17:58,663 --> 00:18:01,943
- Was it an accident? Did he fall?
- We don't know yet.

219
00:18:03,943 --> 00:18:07,823
Can you think why he might have been up
on the cliffs last night or this morning?

220
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:11,261
- He wouldn't have been.
- Well, he obviously was.

221
00:18:11,262 --> 00:18:13,263
He didn't have any reason to be.

222
00:18:14,703 --> 00:18:17,221
How was Danny over the past few
days?

223
00:18:17,222 --> 00:18:20,103
He didn't kill himself
if that's what you're suggesting.

224
00:18:20,104 --> 00:18:23,143
He's been just... normal.

225
00:18:24,903 --> 00:18:28,943
He wouldn't kill himself. He knows
he can talk to us about anything.

226
00:18:29,343 --> 00:18:31,183
And you last saw him when?

227
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:35,423
I looked in on him er...

228
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:38,302
about nine o'clock last night.

229
00:18:38,303 --> 00:18:40,903
He was laying in bed reading.

230
00:18:44,223 --> 00:18:45,821
Anyone see Danny this morning?

231
00:18:45,822 --> 00:18:49,623
No. He was up and out before anyone
else. He's got a paper round.

232
00:18:51,223 --> 00:18:54,143
But he didn't turn up for that.
Jack, I spoke to him.

233
00:18:54,144 --> 00:18:56,143
He runs the paper shop.

234
00:18:58,223 --> 00:19:01,543
Any signs of forced entry
or disturbance round the house?

235
00:19:01,544 --> 00:19:03,543
No, nothing.

236
00:19:04,463 --> 00:19:06,463
I wanna see the body.

237
00:19:10,423 --> 00:19:12,263
You might be wrong about it being
him.

238
00:19:13,223 --> 00:19:15,863
So, I wanna be sure. I wanna see.

239
00:19:26,023 --> 00:19:28,703
- How many times you done this, Ell?
- I haven't.

240
00:19:30,383 --> 00:19:32,022
Thanks a lot.

241
00:19:32,023 --> 00:19:34,181
Mark! All right, buddy?
All right, Trev?

242
00:19:34,182 --> 00:19:36,783
What you in here for? Nothing
serious, I hope?

243
00:19:37,183 --> 00:19:39,261
- Nah.
- Sign this petition, will you?

244
00:19:39,262 --> 00:19:42,301
- They're threatening to close this place down.
- In a bit of a rush.

245
00:19:42,302 --> 00:19:45,263
Oh, come on. Won't take two seconds.
It's important.

246
00:19:45,823 --> 00:19:50,343
Ah, good man. Hey, coming to
skittles, the Lion on Tuesday?

247
00:19:50,863 --> 00:19:53,863
The Yetminster. Grudge match.
I don't know, mate.

248
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:58,223
See how it goes, eh? Right. Give my
love to Beth and the kids.

249
00:21:23,543 --> 00:21:25,663
All this way I thought it wouldn't
be him.

250
00:21:30,143 --> 00:21:32,143
My Danny.

251
00:21:36,463 --> 00:21:38,943
Can I touch him, Ell?

252
00:21:44,023 --> 00:21:46,023
Why him, eh, Ell?

253
00:21:50,543 --> 00:21:52,823
He's only little, isn't he? He's
just...

254
00:21:55,543 --> 00:21:57,863
He's just my little boy, isn't he?

255
00:22:06,583 --> 00:22:08,583
Listen, boy.

256
00:22:10,103 --> 00:22:12,103
Er...

257
00:22:15,703 --> 00:22:18,543
I'm... I'm sorry that I
er...

258
00:22:21,663 --> 00:22:24,303
that I wasn't there for you and
er...

259
00:22:31,223 --> 00:22:33,223
You're... you're my...

260
00:22:33,743 --> 00:22:36,463
You're my boy, Danny, and I let you
down.

261
00:22:39,423 --> 00:22:41,423
I'm so, so sorry.

262
00:22:49,023 --> 00:22:51,023
I love you zillions, superstar.

263
00:22:55,903 --> 00:22:57,903
I always will.

264
00:23:10,383 --> 00:23:14,863
Was Danny Latimer abducted?
Did someone gain access to the house?

265
00:23:14,864 --> 00:23:16,902
If so, how?

266
00:23:16,903 --> 00:23:19,341
If it wasn't forced entry, who has
the key?

267
00:23:19,342 --> 00:23:22,863
We need to collect any CCTV
from a mile radius around the house.

268
00:23:23,823 --> 00:23:26,543
Miller - family.
Who are they and where were they?

269
00:23:28,463 --> 00:23:31,623
Beth had Chloe, their eldest
daughter, when she was 15.

270
00:23:31,624 --> 00:23:33,382
Mark was 17.

271
00:23:33,383 --> 00:23:36,141
Mum and daughter were at home
watching telly.

272
00:23:36,142 --> 00:23:39,181
They say they didn't leave the house
until school next morning.

273
00:23:39,182 --> 00:23:42,661
Dad was out on an emergency
call-out. He's a plumber.

274
00:23:42,662 --> 00:23:46,463
He got in around three. Neither
parent thought to check on Danny.

275
00:23:47,183 --> 00:23:51,223
Gran lives nearby. She was in all
evening. The other gran lives
in Wales.

276
00:23:52,343 --> 00:23:55,063
Until we're ready all of this remains
confidential.

277
00:23:55,663 --> 00:23:58,143
No gossip. Do you understand?

278
00:23:59,983 --> 00:24:01,983
All right. Go on.

279
00:24:03,223 --> 00:24:04,901
Given the nature of this case

280
00:24:04,902 --> 00:24:07,303
it makes sense to hand it on to
another lead officer.

281
00:24:07,423 --> 00:24:08,622
No.

282
00:24:08,623 --> 00:24:12,501
It's nothing to do with your
ability. We don't want Sandbrook
to become a thing.

283
00:24:12,502 --> 00:24:15,701
I was completely exonerated.
Alec, you came down here to lie low.

284
00:24:15,702 --> 00:24:17,621
I came to do whatever the job
requires.

285
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:20,341
But in terms of public perception,
you may be vulnerable.

286
00:24:20,342 --> 00:24:23,863
I'm giving you the chance to step
back. Nobody will blame you.

287
00:24:25,263 --> 00:24:27,981
This happened
a stone's throw from your station.

288
00:24:27,982 --> 00:24:30,261
I've met your team. No-one's as
qualified as me.

289
00:24:30,262 --> 00:24:34,463
Sandbrook doesn't make me vulnerable.
It makes me the best man for the job.

290
00:24:36,703 --> 00:24:38,983
You wanna stop me, you're welcome to
try.

291
00:24:41,703 --> 00:24:43,703
Thanks for the 99.

292
00:24:54,806 --> 00:24:57,204
What did Jenkinson want?
Jenkinson?

293
00:24:57,205 --> 00:24:59,846
The Chief Super. I saw you walking
with her. No.

294
00:25:00,926 --> 00:25:04,926
I did, you were having 99s. Miller,
your son went to school with Danny.

295
00:25:04,953 --> 00:25:06,871
Does he know yet?
No.

296
00:25:06,872 --> 00:25:10,190
You need to talk to him.
Tomorrow. I'll tell him tonight.

297
00:25:10,191 --> 00:25:12,592
And, sir, do you mind not calling me
Miller?

298
00:25:12,912 --> 00:25:15,352
Why? I don't really like the surname
thing.

299
00:25:15,442 --> 00:25:17,441
I prefer Ellie.
Ellie.

300
00:25:19,121 --> 00:25:21,641
Ellie. No.

301
00:25:24,041 --> 00:25:25,919
Jack, we need to ask you a few
questions.

302
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:28,121
Danny didn't turn up for his round
this morning?

303
00:25:28,961 --> 00:25:31,921
I assumed he was sick.
Did he often miss his round?

304
00:25:31,922 --> 00:25:34,401
They all do, one time or another.

305
00:25:37,441 --> 00:25:40,081
How was Danny yesterday?
No different from usual.

306
00:25:40,161 --> 00:25:42,479
You didn't notice anything on his
mind?

307
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:46,361
He was only in here 15 minutes first
thing. I'm no psychiatrist.

308
00:25:46,362 --> 00:25:48,400
Are you married?
No.

309
00:25:48,401 --> 00:25:50,401
Are you?

310
00:25:52,081 --> 00:25:55,200
They brought him in here, Mark and
Beth.

311
00:25:55,201 --> 00:25:57,001
Three days old, he was.

312
00:25:58,441 --> 00:25:59,841
It's not right.

313
00:26:04,601 --> 00:26:08,121
What do you have? Superficial cuts
and bruises to the face.

314
00:26:09,281 --> 00:26:12,920
Traces of domestic cleaning fluid on
the skin.

315
00:26:12,921 --> 00:26:15,521
Cause of death was asphyxiation.

316
00:26:16,721 --> 00:26:18,680
He was strangled.

317
00:26:18,681 --> 00:26:21,681
Bruising to the neck and windpipe
and at the top of the spine.

318
00:26:22,281 --> 00:26:26,240
The pattern of bruises suggest large
hands.

319
00:26:26,241 --> 00:26:28,241
I'd suggest er... male.

320
00:26:29,721 --> 00:26:32,560
It erm... it would have been brutal.

321
00:26:32,561 --> 00:26:36,760
The angle suggests he would have
been facing his attacker.

322
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:39,001
Er... He would have known.

323
00:26:39,441 --> 00:26:42,561
Any sexual violence?
Mercifully, no.

324
00:26:44,281 --> 00:26:46,040
The time of death?

325
00:26:46,041 --> 00:26:50,441
Er, I'd put it between 10pm Thursday
night and 4am Friday morning.

326
00:26:52,921 --> 00:26:54,921
Thank you.

327
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:59,361
We don't get these around here.

328
00:27:00,641 --> 00:27:02,481
Make sure you find them.

329
00:27:34,161 --> 00:27:37,521
We have some preliminary
findings.

330
00:27:39,561 --> 00:27:42,441
We are treating Danny's death
as suspicious.

331
00:27:42,442 --> 00:27:44,640
Oh.

332
00:27:44,641 --> 00:27:46,519
We think he may have been killed.

333
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:49,399
I should have checked on him
before I went to bed.

334
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,639
If I'd checked...
Beth, this is not your fault.

335
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:54,041
Whatever happened, this is not down
to you.

336
00:27:57,001 --> 00:27:58,640
I promise...

337
00:27:58,641 --> 00:28:00,641
we will find the person responsible.

338
00:28:00,642 --> 00:28:02,641
Oh, my God.

339
00:28:03,921 --> 00:28:05,641
You have my word.

340
00:28:08,721 --> 00:28:10,201
He's a little boy.

341
00:28:28,881 --> 00:28:30,881
Chlo, I don't know what to say.

342
00:28:31,801 --> 00:28:33,321
I know.

343
00:28:33,401 --> 00:28:35,400
It doesn't feel real.

344
00:28:35,401 --> 00:28:36,881
Are the police round?

345
00:28:36,961 --> 00:28:38,641
Come on, let's go. I want to do this.

346
00:28:38,642 --> 00:28:40,200
Seriously?

347
00:28:40,201 --> 00:28:41,760
What did they ask you?

348
00:28:41,761 --> 00:28:44,201
Do they know about us? Cos you ain't
16 yet.

349
00:28:44,202 --> 00:28:46,201
Nobody knows. Let's go.

350
00:29:01,081 --> 00:29:02,760
Are you OK?

351
00:29:02,761 --> 00:29:04,839
I'll be better once I've eaten
something.

352
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:06,121
Do you want anything?

353
00:29:06,122 --> 00:29:08,121
No.

354
00:29:08,601 --> 00:29:10,681
Do you think other kids are in
danger?

355
00:29:11,681 --> 00:29:13,560
I don't know.

356
00:29:13,561 --> 00:29:15,561
Maybe.

357
00:29:31,601 --> 00:29:33,601
Are you sure you're OK?

358
00:29:35,481 --> 00:29:37,481
Do you want me to do it?

359
00:30:11,761 --> 00:30:12,920
Hello?

360
00:30:12,921 --> 00:30:14,199
Is it Danny Latimer?

361
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,481
I can't talk to you.

362
00:30:15,561 --> 00:30:19,641
I've seen Chloe at the beach. It is,
isn't it? This isn't appropriate,
Oliver.

363
00:30:19,642 --> 00:30:22,681
It is him. Oh, my God. The poor kid.

364
00:30:23,201 --> 00:30:25,759
I did not confirm that. This is not a
confirmation.

365
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,761
No, I understand, Auntie Ellie.

366
00:30:28,961 --> 00:30:29,961
Olly...

367
00:30:35,241 --> 00:30:37,360
Hi, it's Olly. Leave a message.

368
00:30:37,361 --> 00:30:39,599
Answer my bloody calls. I did not
confirm that.

369
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:42,801
You cannot speculate about this
incident. Are we clear?

370
00:31:28,841 --> 00:31:31,119
Karen, you might want to see this.
Not now, Sam.

371
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:35,279
I've this Department of Education
press release that's got to sound
like essential news.

372
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:37,799
It's barely in English.
Who teaches these people?

373
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:41,559
You said tell you if anything comes
on the local paper Twitter feeds.

374
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,839
Go on, then, quick.
Body found on Dorset beach.

375
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:46,079
Young boy, possible suspicious
death.

376
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,361
OK. Have you got a link you can send
me?

377
00:31:48,362 --> 00:31:49,680
Already did.

378
00:31:49,681 --> 00:31:51,680
You already did.

379
00:31:51,681 --> 00:31:53,681
Thanks.

380
00:31:53,801 --> 00:31:57,039
This is how grateful I am. I'm going
to give you the last of my muffin.

381
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,361
So how's it going?
Great. Two minutes.

382
00:32:23,481 --> 00:32:26,839
I'm going to take Danny's computer
away for examination.

383
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:29,759
Will they get it back? Sure, as soon
as we've finished with it.

384
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,799
It's got his stuff on it.
We'll be careful.

385
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,239
Why have you released his name?

386
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,999
Did you agree to that?
What?

387
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,239
It's on Twitter. From the
Broadchurch Echo. Daniel Latimer.

388
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,879
Why have they done that?
Talk to the officer in charge.

389
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,879
Nobody told us this was going to
happen.

390
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,881
Aren't they supposed to consult?

391
00:32:45,041 --> 00:32:47,041
How do you know anyway?

392
00:32:47,721 --> 00:32:51,119
I've got a Google alert
on "Broadchurch" and "death".

393
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:54,479
Oh, for goodness' sake, Chloe!
Well, it's a good job I have

394
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:57,521
otherwise we wouldn't have known.
Known what?

395
00:33:00,001 --> 00:33:02,001
For God's sake!

396
00:33:03,041 --> 00:33:05,160
Bloody Twitter!

397
00:33:05,161 --> 00:33:07,759
These people's lives have been
destroyed

398
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:10,201
and now our incompetence has made it
worse.

399
00:33:11,321 --> 00:33:14,161
Think what we have to do now
to rebuild trust there.

400
00:33:15,801 --> 00:33:17,801
Who told the journalist?

401
00:33:23,281 --> 00:33:25,281
I think it might have been me.

402
00:33:29,081 --> 00:33:30,200
Your nephew?

403
00:33:30,201 --> 00:33:32,039
He saw Danny's sister at the beach.

404
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:36,439
I didn't tell him anything. I told
him not to publish. He's a
little shit.

405
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:39,401
I'll read the riot act and I'll
explain to the family.

406
00:33:41,201 --> 00:33:43,201
Go away.

407
00:33:45,641 --> 00:33:47,641
Shit, shit, shit, shit! Shit!

408
00:33:48,481 --> 00:33:50,481
Hi, Nick.
Ma'am.

409
00:34:02,224 --> 00:34:06,283
This is a short statement
to confirm that this morning

410
00:34:06,322 --> 00:34:10,602
the body of an 11-year-old child
was found on Harbour Cliff Beach

411
00:34:10,603 --> 00:34:12,921
at Broadchurch.

412
00:34:12,922 --> 00:34:16,761
The body was subsequently identified
as Daniel Latimer,

413
00:34:16,762 --> 00:34:18,801
who lived in the town.

414
00:34:18,802 --> 00:34:20,800
We are treating his death as
suspicious.

415
00:34:20,801 --> 00:34:25,360
Our investigations are continuing and
there'll be a full briefing later
this evening.

416
00:34:25,361 --> 00:34:30,042
We ask the media respect the family's
privacy at this time. Thank you.

417
00:34:30,043 --> 00:34:31,401
Can you believe it?

418
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:33,600
He got another job even after
Sandbrook.

419
00:34:33,601 --> 00:34:36,360
Boss... Suspicious death.
Kid on Dorset beach.

420
00:34:36,361 --> 00:34:39,640
Gender? Age? Boy. 11. I want to go
down. There could be...

421
00:34:39,641 --> 00:34:42,560
Not for that. It's the wrong profile.
It'll cost too much.

422
00:34:42,561 --> 00:34:44,440
Let an agency do it. You can jazz it
up.

423
00:34:44,441 --> 00:34:48,162
Oh, come on, all I'm doing these
days is polishing press releases.

424
00:34:48,522 --> 00:34:50,202
Pretty please.

425
00:34:56,922 --> 00:34:58,561
Hello.
Hi.

426
00:34:58,562 --> 00:35:00,322
Long day?
Yeah.

427
00:35:03,842 --> 00:35:05,881
It's really tragic.

428
00:35:05,882 --> 00:35:10,442
Can't bear to think what the family
must be going through. We're all
in shock.

429
00:35:15,562 --> 00:35:18,962
Actually, do you think the beach
will be open tomorrow? I...

430
00:35:19,762 --> 00:35:22,560
Only so I know what to tell the
guests. I don't know.

431
00:35:22,561 --> 00:35:26,882
I've had an early check-out and
a cancellation just tonight. So...

432
00:35:29,842 --> 00:35:31,761
I'm going up.

433
00:35:31,762 --> 00:35:34,962
Oh, sorry, there's two people
waiting for you in the bar.

434
00:35:44,322 --> 00:35:46,361
Well, go on.

435
00:35:46,362 --> 00:35:49,762
I was wrong to post that news. I'm
sorry.

436
00:35:51,442 --> 00:35:54,842
I should hang him by the bollocks
from the town hall spire.

437
00:35:55,442 --> 00:35:58,082
All reporting on this will come
through me now.

438
00:35:58,083 --> 00:36:00,402
The Echo works with the police.

439
00:36:01,642 --> 00:36:04,482
I'll... I'll speak to the Latimer
family.

440
00:36:04,483 --> 00:36:06,842
Give them our apologies.

441
00:36:08,442 --> 00:36:10,442
Stay out of my way.

442
00:36:27,962 --> 00:36:29,962
Thanks for bringing me.

443
00:36:31,722 --> 00:36:34,002
I used to come down here when he was
a baby.

444
00:36:36,282 --> 00:36:38,162
Middle of the day, just me and him.

445
00:36:40,522 --> 00:36:42,762
I'd pick him up and dip him in the
waves.

446
00:36:43,962 --> 00:36:45,962
His little fat legs would be all
wet.

447
00:36:47,362 --> 00:36:49,442
God, he loved it. He laughed like
mad.

448
00:36:50,762 --> 00:36:52,762
I used to do the same with Tom.

449
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:55,002
Does he know?

450
00:36:57,762 --> 00:36:59,801
Promise me, Ellie, because...

451
00:36:59,802 --> 00:37:03,242
I don't know your boss from Adam
and me and you go back...

452
00:37:03,962 --> 00:37:05,962
The boys go back.

453
00:37:06,402 --> 00:37:08,522
I'm counting on you to get them
caught.

454
00:37:08,922 --> 00:37:10,602
I swear.

455
00:37:13,122 --> 00:37:15,122
He did know, didn't he?

456
00:37:16,442 --> 00:37:18,442
That I loved him.

457
00:37:18,962 --> 00:37:20,561
Of course he did.

458
00:37:20,562 --> 00:37:23,242
He was a beautiful boy, Beth.
You don't deserve this.

459
00:37:23,243 --> 00:37:25,962
I just... I just feel... like...

460
00:37:26,962 --> 00:37:29,002
very far away from myself.

461
00:37:38,122 --> 00:37:40,161
Here's Mummy!

462
00:37:40,162 --> 00:37:42,882
Look at you still up.

463
00:37:43,162 --> 00:37:45,201
And eating yoghurt.

464
00:37:45,202 --> 00:37:47,522
You love yoghurt, especially wearing
it.

465
00:37:47,523 --> 00:37:51,761
I'm only here for a shower.
I've got to get back.

466
00:37:51,762 --> 00:37:53,241
Are things bad?

467
00:37:53,242 --> 00:37:55,242
Need a hug?

468
00:37:59,642 --> 00:38:01,682
How was your day?

469
00:38:02,602 --> 00:38:04,201
Or shouldn't I ask?

470
00:38:04,202 --> 00:38:08,040
Second go at tea. First one was
a bit of an apocalypse, wasn't it?

471
00:38:08,041 --> 00:38:10,082
Thank you, Mummy.
And I'm still smiling.

472
00:38:10,962 --> 00:38:12,402
Oh, no, Mummy.
Thank you.

473
00:38:12,403 --> 00:38:15,042
Where's Tom?
In bed.

474
00:38:16,162 --> 00:38:17,601
Does he know?
No.

475
00:38:17,602 --> 00:38:19,802
I got the text, kept him away from
it all.

476
00:38:20,922 --> 00:38:22,962
I can't...

477
00:38:23,482 --> 00:38:26,762
Do you know what happened? Should we
be worried, for other kids?

478
00:38:26,763 --> 00:38:27,961
Don't know yet.

479
00:38:27,962 --> 00:38:30,002
I'll go up and tell him in a minute.

480
00:38:31,802 --> 00:38:33,802
How's the new boss?

481
00:38:35,482 --> 00:38:37,522
Come here.

482
00:38:41,522 --> 00:38:43,522
It's all right.

483
00:38:44,642 --> 00:38:46,121
It's not all right.

484
00:38:46,122 --> 00:38:48,122
Come here.

485
00:38:49,962 --> 00:38:52,882
I saw him lying there. I don't think
I can do this.

486
00:38:57,122 --> 00:38:58,322
You can.

487
00:39:06,242 --> 00:39:08,602
I keep thinking he's going to walk
back in.

488
00:39:10,882 --> 00:39:13,242
Every time my phone goes, I think
it's Danny.

489
00:39:15,802 --> 00:39:18,162
Why didn't you look in on him last
night?

490
00:39:18,402 --> 00:39:19,521
Beth...

491
00:39:19,522 --> 00:39:23,242
You always look in on him when you
come to bed. Why didn't you see
he was gone?

492
00:39:26,882 --> 00:39:28,882
Why didn't you?

493
00:39:31,562 --> 00:39:33,762
Where were you last night?

494
00:39:37,962 --> 00:39:40,002
I told you. I was on a job.

495
00:39:55,482 --> 00:39:57,642
You know Danny wasn't at school
today?

496
00:39:58,802 --> 00:40:00,802
Yeah.

497
00:40:03,762 --> 00:40:05,802
Tom, sweetheart...

498
00:40:10,042 --> 00:40:12,121
Danny died.

499
00:40:12,122 --> 00:40:14,122
I'm so sorry.

500
00:40:16,682 --> 00:40:18,521
How?

501
00:40:18,522 --> 00:40:20,522
I don't know yet.

502
00:40:21,242 --> 00:40:23,762
He was found on the beach early this
morning.

503
00:40:27,482 --> 00:40:29,162
Does his mum and dad know?

504
00:40:29,163 --> 00:40:31,162
Yeah.

505
00:40:32,282 --> 00:40:34,322
So, look, when...

506
00:40:34,642 --> 00:40:36,682
When someone dies unexpectedly...

507
00:40:37,962 --> 00:40:40,002
it leaves a big hole.

508
00:40:41,402 --> 00:40:44,362
And it's all right to be sad or to
have a cry, OK?

509
00:40:46,442 --> 00:40:48,082
OK.

510
00:40:48,402 --> 00:40:50,122
Will you...? I mean...

511
00:40:50,762 --> 00:40:53,882
Will the police want to ask me
questions?

512
00:40:54,242 --> 00:40:56,242
Yeah.

513
00:40:57,762 --> 00:40:59,882
Is there anything you want to tell me
now?

514
00:41:00,802 --> 00:41:02,802
Was Danny all right?

515
00:41:03,162 --> 00:41:04,961
Yeah.

516
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:06,802
Of course.

517
00:41:09,042 --> 00:41:11,082
I think a hug's a good idea.

518
00:41:20,802 --> 00:41:22,682
You know I love you more than
anything?

519
00:41:22,762 --> 00:41:24,000
More than chocolate?

520
00:41:24,001 --> 00:41:25,602
Even more than chocolate.

521
00:41:25,962 --> 00:41:28,002
I'll be just downstairs.

522
00:41:28,402 --> 00:41:30,722
And don't be embarrassed to have that
cry.

523
00:42:34,682 --> 00:42:36,001
Hello?

524
00:42:36,002 --> 00:42:38,882
Hi, Olly. It's Karen White from the
Daily Herald.

525
00:42:38,883 --> 00:42:40,561
Oh, um, hi.

526
00:42:40,562 --> 00:42:42,880
I saw you broke the story about Danny
Latimer.

527
00:42:42,881 --> 00:42:45,082
I'm down here after a hotel
recommendation.

528
00:42:45,602 --> 00:42:48,640
Oh, right, OK. Where are you at the
moment? The beach.

529
00:42:48,641 --> 00:42:50,760
I see people have started leaving
flowers.

530
00:42:50,761 --> 00:42:54,160
Danny's sister left one of his toys
down there. It must have started it.

531
00:42:54,161 --> 00:42:57,482
Um, OK, so your best option is the
Traders Hotel.

532
00:42:58,202 --> 00:43:01,120
It's opposite our offices on the
high street.

533
00:43:01,121 --> 00:43:04,002
Becca runs it. Tell her you know us,
she'll give you a good rate.

534
00:43:04,003 --> 00:43:05,641
Great. Thanks.

535
00:43:05,642 --> 00:43:08,122
I'll maybe see you around.
Yeah, I hope so, yeah.

536
00:43:08,123 --> 00:43:09,602
I mean, that would...

537
00:43:12,162 --> 00:43:15,842
Who are you putting up at
the Traders? No-one. A girl, woman.

538
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:17,521
Oh, a woman?

539
00:43:17,522 --> 00:43:20,322
I'm off to the media briefing at the
school. Good luck.

540
00:43:20,323 --> 00:43:22,002
Not that you...
I know.

541
00:43:40,882 --> 00:43:42,481
Different suit?

542
00:43:42,482 --> 00:43:44,482
Press conference in 10 minutes.

543
00:43:45,402 --> 00:43:48,522
Look at this. CCTV from town centre
last night.

544
00:43:52,602 --> 00:43:54,041
Is that Danny?

545
00:43:54,042 --> 00:43:57,842
It matches his clothes, height. It
looks like his skateboard.
He wasn't abducted.

546
00:43:57,843 --> 00:43:59,881
He snuck out.

547
00:43:59,882 --> 00:44:02,762
Why? Where was he going?
Who was he meeting?

548
00:44:02,763 --> 00:44:05,521
And where's his skateboard?
Yeah.

549
00:44:05,522 --> 00:44:10,122
I was checking through the list of
belongings recovered from Danny's
body and at home

550
00:44:10,123 --> 00:44:12,242
and there's no mobile phone.

551
00:44:12,402 --> 00:44:16,282
He definitely had one. He and Tom,
my son, had the same model,
virtually identical.

552
00:44:16,283 --> 00:44:18,322
It isn't there?
No.

553
00:44:18,762 --> 00:44:20,481
Check with the family.

554
00:44:20,482 --> 00:44:22,122
Good.

555
00:44:24,042 --> 00:44:28,242
I'm going to hand over now to our
senior investigating officer
DI Alec Hardy.

556
00:44:31,762 --> 00:44:36,002
What advice do you have for people in
the town, particularly parents?

557
00:44:37,482 --> 00:44:41,522
The crime rate in this area
is one of the lowest in the country.

558
00:44:42,762 --> 00:44:44,762
This is a terrible anomaly.

559
00:44:46,762 --> 00:44:53,122
We are in the early moments of what
might be a complex investigation.

560
00:44:57,202 --> 00:45:01,522
Danny's life touched many people and
we'll be looking at all those
connections.

561
00:45:03,842 --> 00:45:06,522
If you or someone you know
has any information,

562
00:45:07,762 --> 00:45:09,602
has noticed anything unusual,

563
00:45:09,603 --> 00:45:11,642
please come forward now.

564
00:45:12,202 --> 00:45:14,522
Um, I'd urge everyone, don't hide
anything...

565
00:45:16,482 --> 00:45:17,882
because we will find out.

566
00:45:18,042 --> 00:45:23,001
If a member of your family or a
friend or a neighbour

567
00:45:23,002 --> 00:45:26,120
has been behaving differently
in the past days or weeks,

568
00:45:26,121 --> 00:45:28,480
please tell the police immediately.

569
00:45:28,481 --> 00:45:31,722
There will be no hiding place for
Danny's killer.

570
00:45:32,002 --> 00:45:34,042
We will catch whoever did this.

571
00:45:44,968 --> 00:46:19,040
