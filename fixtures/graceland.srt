642
00:29:35,686 --> 00:29:38,221
It looks like something that
came out of cracker Jacks box.

643
00:29:38,289 --> 00:29:40,290
Yeah!

644
00:29:42,226 --> 00:29:43,927
- It's a low-budget film.
- Yeah, right.

645
00:29:43,994 --> 00:29:45,461
To this day,

646
00:29:45,529 --> 00:29:46,996
one of those guys still has
an autographed picture of Briggs

647
00:29:47,064 --> 00:29:48,398
hanging in his cell.
[Laughing]

648
00:29:48,465 --> 00:29:49,866
Wait, wait, wait.
They went through with the buy?

649
00:29:49,934 --> 00:29:52,235
- Yeah, they made the buy.
- We nailed 'em all.

650
00:29:52,303 --> 00:29:56,439
Hey, guys.
I gotta be in this movie.

651
00:29:56,507 --> 00:29:58,341
- You sure you're ready, son?
- Come on, man.

652
00:29:58,409 --> 00:30:00,577
Yeah.

653
00:30:00,644 --> 00:30:02,245
Okay.

654
00:30:02,313 --> 00:30:04,414
If Felix asks,
you tell him that, uh,

655
00:30:04,481 --> 00:30:06,115
you play my brother-in-law.

656
00:30:06,183 --> 00:30:08,017
But it ain't gonna matter,
'cause he ain't gonna ask.

657
00:30:08,085 --> 00:30:09,252
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

658
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:11,354
So I'm married
to the prostitute?

659
00:30:11,422 --> 00:30:12,622
Ha! Yes!

660
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:14,224
Yes, you're married to, uh...

661
00:30:14,291 --> 00:30:15,825
- Lowrider.
- To lowrider.

662
00:30:15,893 --> 00:30:17,460
- Hydraulics.
- [Laughing]

663
00:30:17,528 --> 00:30:19,963
- Ha. I hope he does ask now.
- Yeah, me too.

664
00:30:25,730 --> 00:30:28,332
All right, Escobar.
I need you to put this on.

665
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,633
- Is this plugged in?
- Transmits everything to us.

666
00:30:29,701 --> 00:30:31,568
- Ooh! No wires?
- Not since <i>the wire.</i>

667
00:30:31,636 --> 00:30:33,037
Okay, gimme a level.

668
00:30:33,104 --> 00:30:35,139
[Heightened] It's a pleasure
doing business with you.

669
00:30:35,206 --> 00:30:36,440
We're not trying to play
to the balcony.

670
00:30:36,508 --> 00:30:37,808
Just talk normal.

671
00:30:37,876 --> 00:30:39,076
[Relaxed] Pleasure
doing business with you.

672
00:30:39,144 --> 00:30:40,711
- I assume that's our bust line.
- Yeah.

673
00:30:40,779 --> 00:30:42,780
Start hiring writers.

674
00:30:42,847 --> 00:30:44,415
So I'm in the middle
of breakfast this morning,

675
00:30:44,482 --> 00:30:46,050
and I get a call from FBI ops

676
00:30:46,117 --> 00:30:48,252
asking why
they haven't been informed

677
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,421
that we're running a reverse
on a Vzakonye dealer.

678
00:30:50,488 --> 00:30:52,289
Imagine my surprise

679
00:30:52,357 --> 00:30:54,391
since I didn't know
we had a Vzakonye dealer.

680
00:30:54,459 --> 00:30:56,393
We don't. Pulled him
off the list a month ago.

681
00:30:56,461 --> 00:30:58,662
- And we're doing this why?
- That would be Lauren's idea.

682
00:30:58,730 --> 00:31:01,865
[Scoffs]

683
00:31:01,933 --> 00:31:04,034
Mike Warren, Gerry Silvo.
I'm your gs.

684
00:31:04,102 --> 00:31:05,469
Oh, it's a pleasure, sir.

685
00:31:05,537 --> 00:31:06,570
Let me know
how long that lasts.

686
00:31:06,638 --> 00:31:07,871
It's almost noon.

687
00:31:07,939 --> 00:31:09,106
Briggs taught you
everything he knows yet?

688
00:31:09,174 --> 00:31:10,641
Yes, sir.
Wax on, wax off.

689
00:31:10,709 --> 00:31:13,544
I assume that's an in-joke.
I don't like in-jokes.

690
00:31:13,611 --> 00:31:16,080
- Understood, sir.
- Felix arroyo.

691
00:31:16,147 --> 00:31:17,815
He's got a family,
so he's not likely to rip you.

692
00:31:17,882 --> 00:31:19,049
He's got his wife
and kids in there.

693
00:31:19,117 --> 00:31:20,351
He's not gonna start shooting.

694
00:31:20,418 --> 00:31:22,519
This should be easy.
Yeah, it should be.

695
00:31:22,587 --> 00:31:24,288
Mike, now remember, we're gonna
be arresting you too, okay?

696
00:31:24,356 --> 00:31:26,890
So make it look good in case
his buddies are watching.

697
00:31:26,958 --> 00:31:29,626
- Are you nervous?
- Yes, sir.

698
00:31:29,694 --> 00:31:31,061
That's good.

699
00:31:31,129 --> 00:31:34,264
Let's do this right.

700
00:31:34,332 --> 00:31:37,134
Don't get shot, Mikey.
Kiss for good luck?

701
00:31:37,202 --> 00:31:39,870
No.

702
00:31:56,087 --> 00:31:57,755
Hey, buddy.

703
00:31:57,822 --> 00:31:59,556
Is Felix here?

704
00:31:59,624 --> 00:32:01,959
Dad!

705
00:32:02,026 --> 00:32:04,294
[Dog barks in distance]

706
00:32:04,362 --> 00:32:06,029
- Hmm.
- Hey.

707
00:32:06,097 --> 00:32:07,030
Paul's friend?
Mike.

708
00:32:07,098 --> 00:32:08,265
Felix.

709
00:32:08,333 --> 00:32:11,068
Yeah, come on inside.
Thanks.

710
00:32:11,136 --> 00:32:13,337
You, uh...
you want some lemonade?

711
00:32:13,405 --> 00:32:14,538
No. Thanks.

712
00:32:14,606 --> 00:32:18,041
Irina, grab us
some lemonade, baby.

713
00:32:21,179 --> 00:32:23,080
So you and Paul
are friends, huh?

714
00:32:23,148 --> 00:32:24,915
Yeah, yeah.

715
00:32:24,983 --> 00:32:27,551
I met him, you know, around.

716
00:32:27,619 --> 00:32:29,219
Yeah? Around?

717
00:32:29,287 --> 00:32:31,188
Well, he's...
he's my brother-in-law.

718
00:32:31,256 --> 00:32:33,457
Oh.

719
00:32:33,525 --> 00:32:35,959
Nice to meet you.

720
00:32:36,027 --> 00:32:37,895
I married his sister.

721
00:32:37,962 --> 00:32:40,964
She's a hooker.

722
00:32:41,032 --> 00:32:43,333
[Laughing] 20 bucks says
he shows 'em his badge.

723
00:32:43,401 --> 00:32:44,501
God forbid.

724
00:32:44,569 --> 00:32:46,703
In the movie.
[Laughs]

725
00:32:46,771 --> 00:32:49,173
I play his brother-in-law
in the movie.

726
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:52,075
- You in picture with Paul?
- Yes!

727
00:32:52,143 --> 00:32:53,911
[All laughing] Sorry.

728
00:32:53,978 --> 00:32:55,946
I was gonna say.
My family's messed up.

729
00:32:56,014 --> 00:32:57,047
But yours <i>esta loco!</i>

730
00:32:57,115 --> 00:32:58,649
Whoo. Yeah.

731
00:32:58,716 --> 00:33:01,518
- You also play cop?
- <i>Manos arriba.</i>

732
00:33:01,586 --> 00:33:03,086
Aah!

733
00:33:03,154 --> 00:33:04,555
He's funny.

734
00:33:04,622 --> 00:33:05,956
Stupid.

735
00:33:06,024 --> 00:33:07,157
Felix: Me and Mike are gonna
step out for a minute.

736
00:33:07,225 --> 00:33:08,826
Irina: Of course.

737
00:33:08,893 --> 00:33:11,695
So...

738
00:33:11,763 --> 00:33:14,198
Here's the deal, man.

739
00:33:14,265 --> 00:33:16,633
You know how things,
they get stacked up?

740
00:33:16,701 --> 00:33:17,901
I mean,
this guy doesn't show up.

741
00:33:17,969 --> 00:33:19,203
So now you can't pay that guy.

742
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:20,537
So you're short.

743
00:33:20,605 --> 00:33:21,939
He doesn't have the money.

744
00:33:22,006 --> 00:33:23,941
Looks like we just wasted
an afternoon, fellows.

745
00:33:24,008 --> 00:33:26,176
No, I wish I was short.
I'm out!

746
00:33:26,244 --> 00:33:27,644
It's the economy, you know?

747
00:33:27,712 --> 00:33:30,514
My other guy...
he didn't show up for his stuff.

748
00:33:30,582 --> 00:33:33,016
So... What was
the other guy buying?

749
00:33:33,084 --> 00:33:34,585
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Hold on for a second.

750
00:33:34,652 --> 00:33:36,019
I think the kid's
trying to save it.

751
00:33:36,087 --> 00:33:37,921
So maybe you'd be interested
in some merchandise

752
00:33:37,989 --> 00:33:39,323
in exchange for the indoor?

753
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:41,258
Possibly.
What are we talking about here?

754
00:33:41,326 --> 00:33:43,727
Man, it's good stuff.
Go check it out, man.

755
00:33:43,795 --> 00:33:45,762
It's in the alley.
Come on!

756
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:47,731
You told him not
to change locations, right?

757
00:33:47,799 --> 00:33:49,533
Mike: Sure, let's go.
- No, I did not.

758
00:33:49,601 --> 00:33:50,901
Damn it!

759
00:33:50,969 --> 00:33:51,768
I need somebody out
in that alley right now.

760
00:33:51,836 --> 00:33:52,970
Agent 1: I've lost him.

761
00:33:53,037 --> 00:33:54,404
Agent 2:
Negative. No control.

762
00:33:54,472 --> 00:33:55,739
Agent 1: I can't get in there
without burning it.

763
00:33:55,807 --> 00:33:56,807
I can get somebody
in there on foot.

764
00:33:56,875 --> 00:33:58,242
Do it.

765
00:33:58,309 --> 00:33:59,476
Johnny, you were fast
in fifth grade, weren't you?

766
00:33:59,544 --> 00:34:00,911
[Sighs]

767
00:34:00,979 --> 00:34:03,714
Afterburners, baby.
Let's go.

768
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:11,088
Check it out.

769
00:34:11,155 --> 00:34:15,292
15,000 pairs of Levi's finest.

770
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,693
Jeans?

771
00:34:16,761 --> 00:34:18,328
And you wanna trade
straight across for the eight?

772
00:34:18,396 --> 00:34:19,596
Straight up?

773
00:34:19,664 --> 00:34:21,064
Come on, man.

774
00:34:21,132 --> 00:34:22,733
You can get like 15 bucks a pair
on the street for these.

775
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,801
That's... how much is that?
180,000.

776
00:34:24,869 --> 00:34:26,270
Yeah!
That's a lot of money, Mike.

777
00:34:26,337 --> 00:34:28,138
Yeah, and I'll bet your wife
is chewing your ear off

778
00:34:28,206 --> 00:34:31,742
to get this truck outta here.

779
00:34:31,809 --> 00:34:33,544
- I'll tell you what.
- [Chuckles]

780
00:34:33,611 --> 00:34:35,445
If you can make this disappear,

781
00:34:35,513 --> 00:34:36,647
then you got a deal.

782
00:34:36,714 --> 00:34:38,582
I'll see what I can do.

783
00:34:38,650 --> 00:34:39,983
Pleasure doing business
with you, Felix.

784
00:34:40,051 --> 00:34:42,386
[Laughing]

785
00:34:42,453 --> 00:34:45,856
Stop! Federal bureau!
Federal bureau!

786
00:34:45,924 --> 00:34:47,691
What is that guy yelling?

787
00:34:47,759 --> 00:34:49,293
Federal bureau!

788
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,294
Federal bureau!
[Sirens blaring]

789
00:34:50,361 --> 00:34:52,596
Federal bureau!

790
00:34:59,704 --> 00:35:01,805
Spread it!
You're both under arrest.

791
00:35:01,873 --> 00:35:03,373
Come on!

792
00:35:03,441 --> 00:35:05,609
How come you weren't so damn
[Murmuring indistinctly]?

793
00:35:05,677 --> 00:35:07,644
What's wrong with you, man?

794
00:35:09,847 --> 00:35:11,582
Damn, I knew those jeans
were bad luck.

795
00:35:21,859 --> 00:35:23,327
- Hey, nice job, rookie.
- [Laughing]

796
00:35:23,394 --> 00:35:24,461
Thanks, man.

797
00:35:26,397 --> 00:35:28,131
What the hell
are you idiots doing?

798
00:35:28,199 --> 00:35:30,000
You're not supposed
to bring him through here!

799
00:35:30,068 --> 00:35:31,835
- Mike?
- Get him outta here!

800
00:35:31,903 --> 00:35:34,638
- That's messed up.
- Get him outta here.

801
00:35:34,706 --> 00:35:36,106
Damn.

802
00:35:36,174 --> 00:35:37,874
Hey! What happened?

803
00:35:37,942 --> 00:35:41,078
- They walked Felix into Mike.
- It happened.

804
00:35:41,145 --> 00:35:43,213
It's over.

805
00:36:01,866 --> 00:36:03,533
[Dog whimpers] Mangy little...

806
00:36:09,374 --> 00:36:11,408
You are not gonna make this
easy on me, are you?

807
00:36:29,594 --> 00:36:33,063
Sergei Nayfeld.
24, Felix arroyo.

808
00:36:33,131 --> 00:36:35,132
[Buzzer]

809
00:36:35,199 --> 00:36:38,502
Arroyo!

810
00:36:40,405 --> 00:36:42,939
Your lawyer's here.

811
00:36:52,016 --> 00:36:54,117
[Buzzer]

812
00:36:54,185 --> 00:36:57,020
[Whispers] Sir, sir, sir.
That man is <i>not</i> my lawyer.

813
00:36:57,088 --> 00:36:59,723
Do not let him bail me out.

814
00:36:59,791 --> 00:37:01,191
Please.

815
00:37:41,032 --> 00:37:43,066
- Hey, levi.
- Levi?

816
00:37:43,134 --> 00:37:44,367
Yeah, you need a nickname.

817
00:37:44,435 --> 00:37:45,802
- I don't think I like levi.
- Too bad.

818
00:37:45,870 --> 00:37:47,971
You don't get to choose
your nickname, do you, Johnny?

819
00:37:48,039 --> 00:37:49,406
- "Johnny" is a nickname?
- Yep.

820
00:37:49,474 --> 00:37:51,341
Briggs gave it to me.
It's my character in the movie.

821
00:37:51,409 --> 00:37:52,909
Man, you put everyone
in the movie, don't you?

822
00:37:52,977 --> 00:37:54,144
He begged.
[Laughter]

823
00:37:54,212 --> 00:37:55,612
Check this.
Tuturro and Briggs

824
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,614
were undercover
with this biker gang.

825
00:37:57,682 --> 00:38:00,183
Tuturro figures
if Briggs can do it he can too.

826
00:38:00,251 --> 00:38:01,718
- Damn right.
- [Mocking laughter]

827
00:38:01,786 --> 00:38:03,553
So he tells 'em that he plays
this tough-guy killer.

828
00:38:03,621 --> 00:38:04,888
Yeah.

829
00:38:04,956 --> 00:38:06,256
Without missing a beat,
Briggs tells him,

830
00:38:06,324 --> 00:38:07,924
"yeah, the guy he shot
was sitting on the toilet."

831
00:38:07,992 --> 00:38:09,259
[Laughter]

832
00:38:09,327 --> 00:38:10,861
He tells them I shoot this dude

833
00:38:10,928 --> 00:38:12,629
when I catch him reading
my dirty mags on the John.

834
00:38:12,697 --> 00:38:13,830
Mmhmm, two slugs.

835
00:38:13,898 --> 00:38:15,165
One in the arm,
one right in the chest.

836
00:38:15,233 --> 00:38:16,700
Couldn't even make me
a good shot, could you?

837
00:38:16,768 --> 00:38:19,169
Bikers started calling him
Johnny after that, and it stuck.

838
00:38:19,237 --> 00:38:21,004
You know what, I like it.
Here's to Johnny.

839
00:38:21,072 --> 00:38:22,939
Do you?
I'm glad you like it, levi.

840
00:38:23,007 --> 00:38:24,241
To levi!

841
00:38:24,308 --> 00:38:26,710
Levi!
To levi.

842
00:38:26,778 --> 00:38:29,312
Levi.

843
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:30,580
Thank you, officer.

844
00:38:30,648 --> 00:38:33,116
[Scoffs]

845
00:38:33,184 --> 00:38:35,118
Wow.

846
00:38:35,186 --> 00:38:36,353
I didn't know
I could afford a lawyer

847
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:38,054
with such a nice suit.

848
00:38:38,122 --> 00:38:40,457
The police tell me
you're a third striker,

849
00:38:40,525 --> 00:38:42,259
and I cannot bail you out.

850
00:38:42,326 --> 00:38:44,961
Yeah.
Stolen jeans.

851
00:38:45,029 --> 00:38:46,596
It's a tough state.

852
00:38:46,664 --> 00:38:48,732
We need assurance
you will not talk to the feds.

853
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,967
I'm not saying nothing.

854
00:38:51,035 --> 00:38:54,304
Just the same, your family
will be staying with us

855
00:38:54,372 --> 00:38:56,306
until this is all over.

856
00:38:56,374 --> 00:38:58,375
No. No, no, no, no.
Please.

857
00:39:00,144 --> 00:39:03,113
I will do anything.

858
00:39:06,717 --> 00:39:08,251
Yes, you will.

859
00:39:08,319 --> 00:39:11,221
Start by telling the truth.

860
00:39:11,289 --> 00:39:13,089
What is this crap
with the jeans?

861
00:39:13,157 --> 00:39:15,025
It's just a side business, man.

862
00:39:15,092 --> 00:39:17,294
We don't take care of you?

863
00:39:17,361 --> 00:39:23,099
Who is this guy
they arrested you with?

864
00:39:23,167 --> 00:39:26,703
It's my brother-in-law.

865
00:39:26,771 --> 00:39:28,705
He's family.

866
00:39:28,773 --> 00:39:29,940
Yeah.

867
00:39:32,310 --> 00:39:34,778
- I'm unpredictable?
- Hey!

868
00:39:34,846 --> 00:39:36,780
What are we celebrating?
What's up, dude?

869
00:39:36,848 --> 00:39:38,915
Levi here
popped his cherry today.

870
00:39:38,983 --> 00:39:40,483
Levi?

871
00:39:40,551 --> 00:39:42,085
[Laughter] Yeah.

872
00:39:42,153 --> 00:39:43,553
Hey, levi!

873
00:39:43,621 --> 00:39:45,255
- Buy you a beer?
- Ah, no, I'm good.

874
00:39:45,323 --> 00:39:48,925
Later then.

875
00:39:48,993 --> 00:39:50,327
Levi.

876
00:39:50,394 --> 00:39:51,761
Tell me a story, man.
A story?

877
00:39:51,829 --> 00:39:53,129
Yeah.

878
00:39:53,197 --> 00:39:54,531
I got no stories.

879
00:39:54,599 --> 00:39:55,866
Well, let's think about that.

880
00:39:55,933 --> 00:39:57,634
You just got yourself
a shiny new nickname.

881
00:39:57,702 --> 00:39:58,902
Mm.

882
00:39:58,970 --> 00:40:00,570
There's a gotta be
a story in that.

883
00:40:00,638 --> 00:40:02,105
All right,
it was a reverse gone wrong,

884
00:40:02,173 --> 00:40:04,441
and I ended up with a truckload
of knockoff jeans.

885
00:40:04,508 --> 00:40:05,775
- Knockoff jeans.
- A truckload.

886
00:40:05,843 --> 00:40:07,978
That is a solid story.

887
00:40:08,045 --> 00:40:10,914
Yeah, you know what?
It is a good story.

888
00:40:10,982 --> 00:40:12,082
What about you?
Me?

889
00:40:12,149 --> 00:40:13,717
You're very protective
of your juice.

890
00:40:13,784 --> 00:40:16,319
Oh, you sensing some deep
psycho-babble in that?

891
00:40:16,387 --> 00:40:18,221
Stayed in that anal phase
too long?

892
00:40:18,289 --> 00:40:19,723
Does not play well with others?

893
00:40:19,790 --> 00:40:22,826
Wow, okay.
So you are an only child.

894
00:40:22,894 --> 00:40:25,362
[Laughs] Look, man,
you caught me on a bad day.

895
00:40:25,429 --> 00:40:27,898
But I bet you
tuturro was up to mischief.

896
00:40:27,965 --> 00:40:29,432
He's the one
who handed you the juice.

897
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:31,501
Am I right?

898
00:40:31,569 --> 00:40:33,036
I knew it.
I <i>knew</i> it.

899
00:40:33,104 --> 00:40:37,407
And you didn't even rat out his
little kale-eating scrawny ass.

900
00:40:37,475 --> 00:40:40,543
Respect, man.

901
00:40:41,879 --> 00:40:43,079
[Music stops]

902
00:40:43,147 --> 00:40:44,581
Let's start with the good news.

903
00:40:44,649 --> 00:40:47,117
Turns out that truck
full of jeans

904
00:40:47,184 --> 00:40:48,451
was lifted off the port.

905
00:40:48,519 --> 00:40:51,321
Which makes it
customs' problem, not mine.

906
00:40:51,389 --> 00:40:52,923
Congratulations, Jakes.

907
00:40:52,990 --> 00:40:56,526
You are now the proud owner
of 12,000 knockoff Levi's...

908
00:40:56,594 --> 00:40:57,727
[Laughter]

909
00:40:57,795 --> 00:41:00,430
Courtesy of your
new bestest buddy Mike.

910
00:41:00,498 --> 00:41:02,933
- We met.
- Aww. Come on, levi.

911
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,401
Bad news is...
You just made bail.

912
00:41:09,874 --> 00:41:11,675
So we're sure
that they have Felix's family.

913
00:41:11,742 --> 00:41:13,109
Yeah.

914
00:41:13,177 --> 00:41:15,612
Felix panicked when the lawyer
asked him about Mike.

915
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:16,913
Said he was
his brother-in-law.

916
00:41:16,981 --> 00:41:19,649
- He said what?
- Yeah. But we got lucky.

917
00:41:19,717 --> 00:41:21,451
Felix does have
a brother-in-law

918
00:41:21,519 --> 00:41:23,453
with a passing resemblance
to Mike.

919
00:41:23,521 --> 00:41:25,855
By which I mean he's white.
Frankie bout.

920
00:41:25,923 --> 00:41:27,457
We gotta do something
about your height.

921
00:41:27,525 --> 00:41:29,326
He's got a scar
above his left eye,

922
00:41:29,393 --> 00:41:31,428
and if it comes up, you've lost
a hell of a lot of weight.

923
00:41:31,495 --> 00:41:35,165
Other than that,
he's a perfect match.

924
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:36,366
[Whispering] One minute.

925
00:41:36,434 --> 00:41:39,336
Mike, come on.

926
00:41:41,672 --> 00:41:44,641
So how's your new job
so far, huh?

927
00:41:44,709 --> 00:41:46,276
Oh, well, it's great.

928
00:41:46,344 --> 00:41:49,179
Cleaned some dishes,
learned how to surf.

929
00:41:49,246 --> 00:41:52,549
So what exactly
is gonna happen here?

930
00:41:52,616 --> 00:41:54,918
Kidnapping a family
is messy, Mike.

931
00:41:54,986 --> 00:41:56,419
All right,
they're bailing you out

932
00:41:56,487 --> 00:41:58,254
because they want assurance
that Felix won't talk.

933
00:41:58,322 --> 00:41:59,456
They think you're family.

934
00:41:59,523 --> 00:42:00,857
They get you to do
something illegal.

935
00:42:00,925 --> 00:42:02,425
Then if Felix talks to us,
they turn you in.

936
00:42:02,493 --> 00:42:03,493
Illegal.

937
00:42:03,561 --> 00:42:05,595
Yeah.

938
00:42:05,663 --> 00:42:08,531
Uh, we've seen them
do this before.

939
00:42:08,599 --> 00:42:11,101
They're gonna ask you
to kill someone...

940
00:42:11,168 --> 00:42:12,569
Mike.

941
00:42:12,636 --> 00:42:14,838
Now all you gotta do
is get a name, okay?

942
00:42:14,905 --> 00:42:16,072
You come back to us, that's it.

943
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:17,574
We got a guy over at the paper,

944
00:42:17,641 --> 00:42:21,011
he'll play ball
with a homicide story, an obit.

945
00:42:21,078 --> 00:42:22,746
They think the guy's dead,
they let the family go.

946
00:42:27,852 --> 00:42:30,420
You don't have to do this.

947
00:42:30,488 --> 00:42:34,257
Yeah, but if I don't,
what happens to that family?

948
00:42:36,794 --> 00:42:39,062
[Sighs]

949
00:42:39,130 --> 00:42:41,731
All right.

950
00:42:41,799 --> 00:42:43,600
All right, we gotta assume
these Russian pricks

951
00:42:43,667 --> 00:42:45,168
have the same intel we do.

952
00:42:45,236 --> 00:42:46,703
You got exactly one hour
to become this guy.

953
00:42:46,771 --> 00:42:48,138
Your name's Frankie bout.
You got it, Mike?

954
00:42:48,205 --> 00:42:49,939
- Frankie bout.
- Yeah.

955
00:42:50,007 --> 00:42:52,242
Your wife's name is Katerina.
She's Felix's wife's sister.

956
00:42:52,309 --> 00:42:53,576
Her name is Irina.
Wait, wait.

957
00:42:53,644 --> 00:42:55,678
Wait, my wife is Katerina
or Felix's?

958
00:42:55,746 --> 00:42:57,313
Yours.

You ever been to chi town?

I drove there once in college.

All right, well,
now you're from there.

You're in withdrawal,

No, no, no.

This guy doesn't have
a gold card.

989
00:43:54,371 --> 00:43:55,405
And the only thing he's doing
with a library card

990
00:43:55,473 --> 00:43:57,006
is chopping his H.

991

All right, Frankie bout,
this is your transmitter, okay?

Now we can hear you,
but you can't hear us.

Yeah.

You're tracking me, right?

1001
00:44:17,094 --> 00:44:18,928
The GPS signal's
too hard to cloak.

But we've got your audio.
